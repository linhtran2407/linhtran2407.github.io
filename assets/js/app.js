Users can also schedule fake incoming call, or make real call to 911 in case of real emergency when the app alone cannot help. The idea came from my personal experience when I was usually cat-called and followed by uneducated men at night. I and my team really hope that the app, when published, can provide some help to other girls/women like me.',

The idea of the game was simple since it is supposed to help players kill free time. I then added algorithm, which was written in Python, such that it guarantees that the mouse will always successfully reach the cheese without getting stuck in the maze regardless of the size of the maze, which can be changed by typing in a custom size that the users want (the larger the size, the more complicated the maze is). When the users click on "Do 1 Step", the mouse will only move 1 step forward the cheese at the end. When the users click "Find the Cheese!", the mouse is immediately brought to the cheese.',
